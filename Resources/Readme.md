## Clean Code

The most basic concept which has sparked more debates and controversies than anything else in Computer Science.
Have you ever thought of tabs vs spaces, snake_case vs CamelCase, verbNoun variable or nounVerb variables, using _is_
with booleans or the right level of abstraction then you know what it means. This is just the beginning.
The term `clean code` is self descriptive and intuitive. So, if you are new to the concept, begin with the following links to get a gist of it.
It is important to understand the concept and form an opinion as it would help you in the long run.

In short Clean code is - 

- Easy to understand
- Easy to modify
- Easy to test
- Works correctly

Rule of thumb: Even donkeys can write code that the machine can understand, call yourself a programmer if the code you write 
               can be read by humans.
